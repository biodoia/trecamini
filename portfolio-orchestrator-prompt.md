# üéØ Portfolio Orchestrator - AI Development Prompts

## üöÄ System Initialization Prompts

### Complete System Setup
```
You are developing Portfolio Orchestrator, a meta-system that manages 90+ GitHub repositories autonomously using AI agents, genetic evolution (AETS), and automated monetization.

Key Requirements:
- Integrate all 90 repositories into a unified system
- Implement AETS genetic evolution for continuous optimization
- Deploy autonomous agent swarms for zero-touch operation
- Create multiple revenue streams targeting $100K+/month
- Use Orchestralia MCP servers for all orchestration

Technical Stack:
- Orchestration: Symphony Conductor + Orchestralia ecosystem
- Evolution: AETS Universal Engine (Python + TypeScript)
- Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase) + Redis + Vector DB
- Infrastructure: Docker + Kubernetes + ProxyMaster
- Monitoring: Grafana + Prometheus

Start by creating the central brain architecture that can discover, analyze, and integrate all projects automatically.
```

### AETS Integration Prompt
```
Implement the AETS (Adaptive Evolutionary Trading System) integration for Portfolio Orchestrator with:

Core Components:
1. Universal evolution engine that works with any project type
2. Gene definitions for e-commerce, SaaS, API, and AI/ML projects
3. Fitness functions based on revenue, performance, and efficiency
4. Population-based evolution with 10 genomes per cycle
5. 6-hour evolution cycles with automatic mutation application

For each project type, define:
- 5-10 optimizable genes with min/max values
- Mutation strategies (numeric, categorical, boolean)
- Fitness calculation weighted by business impact
- Cross-project learning mechanisms

The system should autonomously evolve all parameters without human intervention.
